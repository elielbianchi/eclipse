### Instalattion

Download the path training-system and place where you can find it later.

### Pre Requirements

Before you can actually open the files, you need to download and install the Java SE and Eclipse IDE newest versions.

### How to Use

Open the Eclipse IDE and open the path project that you download from GitHub. Open the Main.java at the package application, and then run it.
After compilation, the menu printed in Portuguese informs you of the options and the commands to perform actions.
This version, 1.0, is already performing the assignment of people to rooms and coffee spaces during the training process. It follows the rule that at least 50% should change de room from the first stage to the second stage.
That is important to mention that this version does not have unit tests and data persistence. These features are planning to be included in the next versions.
